To outline what should be done in each command or method of the `Repository` class, let's go through the common Git commands and repository methods. Below is a high-level explanation of each method's tasks, step-by-step, which can serve as a "to-do" list for implementation:

### 1. **`init()`**
- **Purpose**: Initializes a new Git repository.
- **To-Do**:
    - Create a new `.git` directory.
    - Create subdirectories like `objects`, `refs`, `heads`.
    - Initialize the `HEAD` file pointing to `refs/heads/master`.
    - Create an empty index file (`.git/index`).

### 2. **`add(filePath: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Adds a file to the staging area (index).
- **To-Do**:
    - Read the file's content and calculate its hash using SHA-1.
    - Store the file content in the `objects` folder (as a blob object).
    - Update the index file with the file’s path, permissions, and hash.
    - Manage file modes (executable, regular files).
    - Ensure that the index file is updated with the new entry.

### 3. **`commit(message: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Records changes to the repository.
- **To-Do**:
    - Read the index and gather all staged files.
    - Create a tree object based on the file structure.
    - Create a commit object with the tree hash, parent commit hash (if any), author information, and commit message.
    - Write the commit object to the `objects` folder.
    - Update the `HEAD` to point to the new commit hash.

### 4. **`log()`**
- **Purpose**: Shows the commit history.
- **To-Do**:
    - Read the `HEAD` to get the latest commit.
    - Recursively walk through the parent commits.
    - For each commit, display the author, timestamp, and commit message.

### 5. **`status()`**
- **Purpose**: Displays the working directory and staging area status.
- **To-Do**:
    - Compare the current working directory with the index to find any changes.
    - List files that have been modified, added, or deleted.
    - Check for files that are staged for commit.
    - Display untracked files that aren’t yet in the index.

### 6. **`checkout(commitHash: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Switches to a specific commit, branch, or file.
- **To-Do**:
    - Look up the commit object by hash.
    - Extract the tree object associated with the commit.
    - Update the working directory to reflect the state of the specified commit.
    - Update the `HEAD` to point to the specified commit or branch.

### 7. **`branch(branchName: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Creates a new branch.
- **To-Do**:
    - Create a new reference under `refs/heads/` that points to the current commit.
    - Ensure the `HEAD` stays where it is unless explicitly moved (e.g., by `checkout`).

### 8. **`merge(branchName: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Merges the specified branch into the current branch.
- **To-Do**:
    - Retrieve the latest commit on the current branch and the branch to be merged.
    - Find the common ancestor of both branches.
    - Merge the changes by applying the differences from the common ancestor.
    - Handle conflicts if both branches have modified the same file.
    - Create a merge commit.

### 9. **`tag(tagName: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Tags a commit.
- **To-Do**:
    - Create a tag object that references a specific commit.
    - Store the tag information in the `refs/tags/` directory.
    - Optional: Create an annotated tag with a message, author, and date.

### 10. **`diff()`**
- **Purpose**: Shows changes between commits, working tree, and index.
- **To-Do**:
    - Compare the index with the current working directory to show unstaged changes.
    - Compare the index with the last commit to show staged changes.
    - Optionally, compare two commits for historical differences.

### 11. **`reset(commitHash: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Resets the current branch to a specific commit.
- **To-Do**:
    - Update `HEAD` to point to the given commit.
    - Update the index to match the tree of the specified commit.
    - Optionally, update the working directory to match the commit.

### 12. **`revert(commitHash: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Creates a new commit that undoes the changes introduced by a previous commit.
- **To-Do**:
    - Find the commit object by its hash.
    - Apply an inverse patch to undo the changes in that commit.
    - Create a new commit with the reverted changes.

### 13. **`clone(repoUrl: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Clones a repository from a remote location.
- **To-Do**:
    - Download the remote repository's contents (this can be as simple as copying `.git` contents for local repositories).
    - Set up the local repository with references to the remote repository.
    - Initialize tracking branches.

### 14. **`fetch(remoteUrl: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Fetches updates from a remote repository.
- **To-Do**:
    - Connect to the remote repository and download the latest objects and references.
    - Update the local references (e.g., `refs/remotes/origin/master`).

### 15. **`push(remoteUrl: string)`**
- **Purpose**: Pushes local changes to a remote repository.
- **To-Do**:
    - Authenticate with the remote repository.
    - Compare local references with remote ones to see what needs to be pushed.
    - Send the commit objects, trees, and blobs that aren’t already on the remote.
    - Update the remote references to point to the pushed commits.

### General Notes:

- **Error Handling**: Each method should handle errors (e.g., missing files, invalid paths, permission errors) gracefully.
- **File Operations**: The `FileAdapter` (or any future file handling module) should be used for all reading and writing operations to keep file operations consistent and modular.
- **Logging**: For debugging and tracking purposes, consider adding logs or print statements to show when significant actions are performed (e.g., file written, index updated, etc.).
- **Compression/Decompression**: For object storage, use Git's compression mechanism (zlib) when writing objects to the `objects` directory.

This high-level overview should help you define the structure and behavior of each method in the `Repository` class. If you'd like further clarification on any specific method, feel free to ask!
